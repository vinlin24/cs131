# S23 COM SCI 131 Homework 9

From the [assignment spec](CS131_HW_9.pdf):

In this homework, you’ll explore topics relating to program control (e.g., short
circuiting, iteration). You'll also explore Prolog, creating facts and rules to
answer simple queries, understanding how unification works, and processing
lists. Some questions have multiple, distinct answers which would be acceptable,
so there might not be a “right” answer: what’s important is your ability to
justify your answer with clear and concise reasoning that utilizes the
appropriate terminology discussed in class. Each question has a time estimate;
you’ll know you're ready for the exam when you can solve them roughly within
their time constraints.
