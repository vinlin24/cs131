# S23 COM SCI 131 Homework 5

From the [assignment spec](CS_131_HW_5.pdf):

In this homework, you’ll explore more concepts from data palooza: garbage
collection, parameter passing semantics, and type conversions. Some questions
have multiple, distinct answers which would be acceptable, so there might not be
a “right” answer: what’s important is your ability to justify your answer with
clear and concise reasoning that utilizes the appropriate terminology discussed
in class. Each question has a time estimate; you’ll know you're ready for the
exam when you can solve them roughly within their time constraints.
