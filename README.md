# S23 COM SCI 131: Programming Languages

~~CS major bandwagon of open-sourcing their coursework for more GitHub
contributions, or something. Oh oops, was I not supposed to say that? CS majors,
man.~~

Backup of my homework files and practice exams for my UCLA COM SCI 131 class,
taken Spring 2023 with Professor [Carey
Nachenberg](http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/). All handout files (like
assignment specs and solutions) are already publicly available on [the course
website](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/spring-23/), which also contains TA
lecture notes, links to the lecture slides, and specs and solutions to the
quarter-long project where we built an interpreter for *Brewin*, a custom
language.


## Course Grading

This information is also publicly available on [the
syllabus](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/spring-23/syllabus/).

| Category   | Weight | Notes                   |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Project #1 | 10%    | (graded on correctness) |
| Project #2 | 10%    | (graded on correctness) |
| Project #3 | 10%    | (graded on correctness) |
| Homework   | 10%    | (graded on effort only) |
| Midterm    | 25%    | Open book & notes       |
| Final      | 35%    | Open book & notes       |


## Homework Organization

Each `Homework X/` started as its own repository. This was kind of overkill and
is the reason I have 9 private repositories that are just separate backups I'll
never touch again. This was the primary motivation for bringing everything
together into one large backup.

Within each of the `Homework X/` directories, we have:

* `src/`: Markdown source of my submission as well as code files used to answer
  some of the questions.
* `submission.pdf`: The exported version of my Markdown source. These are the
  files I submitted to Gradescope.
* `CS_131_HW_X.pdf`: Original handout file. Unfortunately the links on the
  [homework page](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/spring-23/homeworks/) redirects
  to a Gradescope submission page, so it's impossible to recover the assignment
  spec unless you happened to be enrolled in the class and saved the file before
  making a submission.
* `CS 131 HW X (Solutions).pdf`: Official solution file.
