# S23 COM SCI 131 Homework 8

From the [assignment spec](CS131_HW_8.pdf):

In this homework, you’ll explore more concepts from OOP palooza. The required
problems touch mainly on different forms of inheritance, polymorphism, and
dynamic dispatch. Some optional problems touch on course topics that are
important, but not directly discussed in lecture (and thus not testable):
abstract classes, details on overloading, and SOLID. Some questions have
multiple, distinct answers which would be acceptable, so there might not be a
“right” answer: what’s important is your ability to justify your answer with
clear and concise reasoning that utilizes the appropriate terminology discussed
in class. Each question has a time estimate; you’ll know you're ready for the
exam when you can solve them roughly within their time constraints.
