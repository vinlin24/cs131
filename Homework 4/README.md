# S23 COM SCI 131 Homework 4

From the [assignment spec](CS_131_HW_4.pdf):

In this homework, you’ll explore the concepts in data palooza: type systems,
scoping, and binding. Compared to other homeworks, you won’t be writing any code
for this one – these questions are focused on your understanding of key
concepts. Some questions have multiple, distinct answers which would be
acceptable, so there might not be a “right” answer: what’s important is your
ability to justify your answer with clear and concise reasoning that utilizes
the appropriate terminology discussed in class. Each question has a time
estimate; you’ll know you're ready for the exam when you can solve them roughly
within their time constraints.
