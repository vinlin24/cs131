# S23 COM SCI 131 Homework 1

From the [assignment spec](CS_131_HW_1.pdf):

This first homework is meant to get you set up for the first few weeks of class,
so you can breathe easy! We’ll make sure you have Haskell (GHC/GHCi) and Python
3 properly installed; there are also a few Haskell exercises to help you warm
up! Each question has a time estimate; you’ll know you're ready for the exam
when you can solve them roughly within their time constraints.
