# S23 COM SCI 131 Homework 6

From the [assignment spec](CS_131_HW_6.pdf):

In this homework, you’ll explore more concepts from function palooza: returning
results, error handling, and a bit about parameter passing.. Some questions have
multiple, distinct answers which would be acceptable, so there might not be a
“right” answer: what’s important is your ability to justify your answer with
clear and concise reasoning that utilizes the appropriate terminology discussed
in class. Each question has a time estimate; you’ll know you're ready for the
exam when you can solve them roughly within their time constraints.
